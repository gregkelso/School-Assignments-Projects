### School-Assignments-Projects
This repository serves as a public archive of some of the more interesting assignments I complete during school. My major is Computer Engineering so most of these will be related to the software projects using Java, Assembly, C, etc.

### NOTE
I will not be uploading all of my code to this public repository. Some school assignments are routinely assigned each semester, and some are more open ended. I will give an example of each situation:

 - In my Operating Systems course, we created a UNIX shell in C, and also had a large assignment that tested our knowledge of Semaphores in Java. These assignments have been assigned several times over the years, without much change. I do not condone cheating, so I will not be uploading the code to these assignments.

 - By contrast, the final project for my Computer Graphics class had us create a video game that demonstrated the technologies and algorithms we had learned throughout the semester. In these cases I will upload these projects to my github account, as a method of version control for me, and also as a public display of my skills as a software engineer.
